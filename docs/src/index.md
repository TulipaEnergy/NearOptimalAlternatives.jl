# Welcome

[NearOptimalAlternatives.jl](https://github.com/TulipaEnergy/NearOptimalAlternatives.jl) is a package for generating near optimal alternative solutions to a solved [JuMP.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) optimization problem. The alternative solutions are within a maximum specified percentage of the optimum and are as different from the optimal solution (and other alternatives) as possible. Alternatives can either be generated using mathematical optimization or using a metaheuristic algorithm. For the latter, this package depends on [Metaheuristics.jl](https://github.com/jmejia8/Metaheuristics.jl).
